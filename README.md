Exploring Citrix/NetScaler configs

This project aims to explore the process of breaking down, analyzing and abstracting applications from a Citrix NetScaler config/archive (.conf/.tgz)

Future goals include conversion outputs for different supported F5 solutions, including BIG-IP TMOS, NGINX and F5 Distributed Cloud (XC)

> It is recommended to install the ns.conf vscode extension by Tim Denholm (timdenholm.netscaler).  This extension provides nice synctax highlighting for the ns config.  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timdenholm.netscaler#overview>.  Great work Tim!

## I need help

Greetings, I need help to grow this tool.  It is at a point where I need feeback from the field about the application abstraction process and diagnostic rules.  Please, use the tool and provide any feedback/issues via github.  ANY and ALL feedback is respected and appreciated.  Thank you.

If your looking to contribute a little more, here are some ways;

- Documentation
- Tuning diagnostic ruleset
- Code (JavaScript/TypeScript)
  - fixing bugs and adding new features
  - take a look at the github issues to see whats going on
- Conversion output
  - Helping to map NS features to F5 features
  - Help design and implement output templating

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Archive unpack and config Parsing (Complete)

This phase is about unpacking an archive and/or parsing the ns.conf file.  

Parsing includes the process of organizing and converting the important config lines into a structure that is a bit more predictable and searchable.  This process basically breaks down the config file into a json structure that allows subsequent processes to realiably search for and access key data when needed. (see breakdown process)

### Phase 2: Application Abstraction (~60% complete)

This phase of the roadmap is focused on crawling the parsed config and abstracting applications.  In these early phases of the project, we have tested with v10 through v13.1.  There is currently no deviation from this process based on these version.  This will probably change as the project progresses.

### Phase 3: Analytics/Diagnostics (~10%)

This phase is focused on analyzing the individual applications produced by the abstraction process.

The foundation is to use vscode diagnostics and supporting ruleset to provide feedback about different ns config pieces/options/parameters

This information may possibly get fed back into the abstration process to help identify key application features for converstion outputs.

### Phase 4: Conversion outputs for XC/TMOS/NGINX (pending)

This phase is focused on utilizing the information gathered from the diagnostics and abstraction process to provide the beginning of deploying a similar application on F5 technology (XC/TMOS/NGINX).

This phase will begin once we have more confidence that phases two and three are providing solid output to base the conversions on.  This is the major request for feedback.  To help fine tune the abstraction and analytics.

The goal here is to provide details about the applications current features on NS/ADC and some output to begin deploying that application in the different F5 technologies.  A single click, production grade application conversion is the goal, but realistically, an understanding of the features and a path/assistance getting there is probably more of where things will land.

These outputs will probably include basic AS3 for TMOS/NEXT, JSON body for deployment on F5 Distributed Cloud, and possibly configuration snippets for NGINX (or declarative json)

### other features

Please check out the github issues for details on bugs and enhancements.  Don't hesitate to open an issue to request a feature, ask a question, or provide feedback.

- a button/form within vscode to easily provide feedback
  - at least a button to open a github issue
- a more detailed breakdown of the different rules in the diagnostics ruleset
  - the idea is to prefix each rule to which F5 technology it applies to, "XC-" for F5 Distributed cloud rules, "TMOS-" for F5 TMOS rules, and "NX-"? for NGINX rules

#### Report output

There is currently a report to output all the details from the tool.  This include all the details about the unpacking/parsing/app-abstraction process and details about the diagnstics.

There are additional stats to understand numbers of applications, breakdown of the different types of applications and supporting configuration objects.  High level diagnostic stats, along with per-app diagnostics are also included.

The goal for this report is to provide a full output to easily search, reference and add notes to when working through the process

## How to get started using the extension

1. Install the extension via the VSCode extension marketplace
2. Open a folder with a Citrix ADC/NS archive/.conf or use the button to browse for the file

- Once the abstraction process has completed.  This should bring you to the new view from project-flipper with the config breakdown
  - Select an application to view it's config
  - Hover over the top menu item to see breakdown stats

<img src="./images/flipper-2.gif" alt="drawing" width="100%"/>

## Breakdown Process

### 1. Archive unpack

> if file is .conf, skip to next step...

- stream archive (.tgz)
  - capture all .conf files
  - certs?
  - logs?


### 2. Breakdown/parse config

- sort the config lines by all the verbs in the following order
  - ['add','set','bind','link','enable','disable']
- loop through each line and break down the parent object reference to be converted to a json tree
  - all the verbs types and names, become nested named objects
  - <verb> (<type>|<type> <subType>) <name> (<details>|<options>|<references>)
  - only parent objects defined in the regex tree will be abstracted!
    - everything else gets left behind

example

```json
{
    "add": {
        "lb": {
            "monitor": {
                "app1-http-monitor": "some monitor configuration details"
            },
            "vserver": {
                "app1-80-vsrv": "details/notes/options/references",
                "app1-443-vsrv": "details/notes/options/references"
            }
        },
        "ssl": {
            "certKey": {
                "cert1": "asdf",
                "key1": "asdf"
            }
        },
        "server": {}
    },
    "bind": {
        "lb": {
            "vserver": {
                "app1-443-vsrv": "bind details"
            }
        }
    },
    "set": {
        "ssl": {
            "cert1": "details"
        }
    }
}
```


### 3. Abstract applications

#### walk cs vservers

This second phase will loop through each 'add vs vserver' and 'add lb vserver' to walk the config tree and abstract each application's config

1. start with each 'add lb vserver'
2. add ssl options with 'set ssl vserver'
3. add pool binding with 'bind lb vserver'
4. add pool details with 'add serviceGroup'
5. add pool bingdings with 'bind serviceGroup'
6. add monitor from service pool binginds 'add lb monitor'

#### walk lb vserver

Add walking details...

#### walk gslb

Add walking details...

## Notes

- All of the 'add' operations need to happen before the 'bind' operations
- the 0.0.0.0:0 in the Netscaler World mean Non-Addressable, the only way to access it is to go through a Content Switching VServer
- **add service** is a single destination definition
- NS WAF was barely used and is not on the roadmap for abstraction or conversion
  - the recommendation would be to just apply a simple modern waf policy
- 'appflow' is a mechanism for capturing application telemetry
  - XC has this built in, TS for TMOS and N+ Promethius endpoints
- order config lines by the following to make sure things are parsed in order
  - add -> set -> bind -> link -> enable -> disable
- .conf are the main config files, like tmos
  - each line is a single config (unlike tmos)
- archive files has an .tgz extension
  - Full and basic backups
- .log for log files
  - location?
- certs?
  - location?
- config lines with ip addresses in them (unique to customer env)
  - add ns ip
  - bind vlan ...
  - add snmp trap generic ...
  - add server <name> <ip>
  - add lb vserver <name> <type> <ip>
  - add cs vserver <name> <type> <ip>
  - add gslb site <name> <ip>
  - set ns rcpNode <ip>
  - seems that **'add lb vserver'** and **'add cs vserver'** are the two to indicate the front door for an app

## ChatGPT

As I started this journey, and knowing very little about NetScaler, I decided to ask ChatGPT and see just how much help it would be.

So, while none of the configs it produced were a straight copy/paste into the respective technologies, it did get most of the way.  Enought to provide a ton of value and help me quickly understand what I was working with.

Here is a document outlining the conversation
